# Puzzle-Runner

During my three-month participation in the TOGO bootcamp, I had the opportunity to build a captivating game as part of a game jam with my team members. This game combines two exciting genres: puzzle and runner.

In the puzzle category, players are tasked with creating animal-themed puzzles. They have the freedom to assemble various puzzle pieces to form complete animal characters. This creative aspect of the game allows players to exercise their problem-solving skills and unleash their imagination.

Once a puzzle is completed, players can then utilize the character they have created in the puzzle phase to navigate through challenging runner levels. These runner levels present a fast-paced and exhilarating gameplay experience, where players must guide their character through dynamic environments, overcoming obstacles and collecting rewards.

The connection between the puzzle and runner categories adds a unique and engaging twist to the game. By successfully completing a puzzle, players unlock the corresponding character, granting them access to new abilities or additional runner levels. This progression system motivates players to engage with both the puzzle-solving and runner aspects of the game, fostering a sense of accomplishment and curiosity.
